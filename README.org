#+TITLE: lubed - List Updates in BundlEd Dependencies

Small utility to track the dependencies of the [[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:saltstack:bundle][Salt Bundle]].


* Installation
#+begin_src shell
zypper install python3-poetry libffi-devel
git clone git@github.com:openSUSE/lubed
cd lubed
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
#+end_src

* Configuration
~lubed~ needs to know where to find the origin of the dependencies.

=config.toml= must include an =origins= table of tables, e.g.
#+begin_src toml
[origins]
[origins.saltbundlepy]
project = "SUSE:SLE-15-SP4:Update"
package = "python310"
#+end_src

Keep in mind that the /name/ is the /OBS Package/ name, and that the OBS API resolves project
inheritance.

* Running ~lubed~
- ~lubed init~ -> saves the current time in =.last_execution=
- ~lubed updates~ -> list packages that have been updated in their origin since
  the timestamp in =.last_execution=.
- ~lubed subprojects-containing saltbundlepy~ -> list all subprojects that
  contain =saltbundlepy=
- ~lubed not-in-conf~ -> list packages in the bundle project that are not in the
  =origins= table in =config.toml=.
- ~lubed create-issue~ -> create a GitHub issue with the list of all packages
  that need an update

* Alternative approach
1. list of bundled packages api /source/<project-name>
2. mapping bundled package -> origin (project/package) (project one of:
   openSUSE:Factory or SUSE:SLE-15-SP4:Update)
3. for all origins: save revision id
4. for all origins: check if revision id changed, produce diff between old and
   new revision
